title: Harper for Obsidian
---

The Harper plugin is a powerful, privacy-first grammar and spell-checking tool designed specifically for Obsidian users. Unlike many other grammar checkers, Harper operates entirely offline, ensuring your data remains secure while providing real-time, high-performance corrections. This plugin is ideal for writers, academics, and developers who value privacy and efficiency in their workflows.

Unlike other offerings (like Grammarly) Harper explicitly ignores the contents of code fences and inline code blocks.

## Key Features

### Privacy-Focused

- Harper runs entirely on your device, meaning no data is sent to external servers.
- Unlike tools like Grammarly or LanguageTool (when not self-hosted), Harper ensures complete ownership and confidentiality of your notes.

### Real-Time Grammar and Spell Checking

- The plugin automatically scans your text as you type, highlighting grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and stylistic inconsistencies.
- Hovering over an error provides instant suggestions for corrections, making editing seamless.

### Lightweight and Fast

- Built with performance in mind, Harper delivers corrections in milliseconds without slowing down even large vaults.
- It has a minimal memory footprint compared to alternatives like LanguageTool, which can require significant resources.

### Open Source

- Harper is fully open source, allowing transparency and community contributions to improve its functionality.
- Developers can review the codebase or contribute directly via the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/automattic/harper-obsidian-plugin).

For our Zed integration, we have a [community-maintained extension](https://github.com/Stef16Robbe/harper_zed) that automatically downloads and runs [`harper-ls`](./language-server). For more information on how to install it and how it works, you can head over to the [extension's README](https://github.com/Stef16Robbe/harper_zed/blob/main/README.md).

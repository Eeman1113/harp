# `harper-cli`

## What?

`harper-cli` is a small, experimental frontend for Harper.
It can be used in any situation where you might need to check a large number of files automatically (like in continuous integration).

Right now it is quite feature barren, mainly because an external use-case has not been defined yet.
If you have any thoughts, feel free to reach out.

## Possible Future Features

- On-disk caching
- Custom dictionaries (maybe use the same ones as `harper-ls`?)
- Machine-readable output

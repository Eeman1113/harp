# Native American Assimilation and Activism Week Two Reflection

> This is the first in a bi-weekly series that I will be publishing for my Native
American Assimilation and Activism class. Every two weeks we make posts
sharing what we learned in the class. Unfortunately, due to weather in England I
was unable to make it back to the United States in time for the first lecture.

One of the key discussions in Monday's lecture/discussion was since time
immemorial and teaching around that. Time Immemorium is a period before
human memory, and involved other human species, travel stories, and creation
stories. Some of the key lessons I learned from that class were:

* Humans branched from some common ancestor that had multiple other human species branch off
    * We are not evolved from chimps but also have a shared ancestor
* Many genetic evolutional specializations have to do with environmental adaptation
    * Some of these adaptations were shared when isolated groups had visitors (Weaving rivers theory)
    * Also related: Intergenerational Trauma

Oregon and Washington have been leading the country when it comes to
integrating Native Americans into their school curriculum. This includes
adding Since Time Immemorium curriculum. These advances have the
possibility to significantly improve the awareness and appreciation of Native
American Peoples who have and still live in these lands.
